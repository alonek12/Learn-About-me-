## 📈 Current Projects  

### 🔹 **DiscordRPCWebsiteExtended**  
**User Account Automation:** Automating user account processes for Weather.com using Selenium and Python.  

### 🔹 **Python (Color Coded Triggerbot)**  
A **triggerbot coded in Python** using OpenCV to perform image recognition based on certain colors. It detects a target (color), snaps to it, and simulates firing. In most games, it simply replicates a left-click action.  

### 🔹 **Automation Script Devving**  
Currently **taking requests** for script ideas in other automation languages such as **AHK, Tampermonkey** (not really automation, but close), and similar tools.
